				<h3>What are baozi?</h3>
				
				<section>
					<p><b>Baozi</b> (包子) or simply <b>bao</b> is a type of yeast-leavened filled bun found throughout various types of Chinese cuisine. Baozi are very popular all throughout China and have made their way into the cuisines of many other countries through the wider Chinese diaspora. The majority of baozi are steamed, but some types are fried or cooked as well. Baozi can be made with all sorts of fillings from spicy meat, to savory vegetables, and even sweet red bean paste and custard. 
					<br><br>
					Although there are many different types of baozi, two major types most commonly found across most parts of China are dà bāo (大包, "big bun") and xiǎo bāo (小包, "small bun"). Dà bāo are usually around 4 inches across and commonly purchased for takeout, whereas xiǎo bāo are only about half that size and are most commonly eaten in restaurants. A typical order of baozi from a restaurant will include a steamer with 3-10 buns, as well as a small dish for dipping sauces. Common dipping sauces include vinegar, soy sauce, chili paste, garlic paste, oils, fresh coriander, sesame oil, and many other flavorings. </p>

				<h3>Xiǎolóng bāo (小籠包)</h3>
				<section class="text_pic">
					<p>Xiao long bao are commonly translated to soup dumplings* in English. This bao is small (hence the xiǎo) with a thin, partially leavened dough and filled with a juicy pork broth seasoning with Shaoxing wine, green onion, ginger, light soy sauce, sesame oil. They originate in Shanghai, but they rose to international fame by way of the Taiwanese chain Din Tai Fung. Each xiaolongbao has eighteen folds on top.<br><br>
					<i>*Despite being called soup dumplings in English, xiaolongbao are not dumplings. "Dumpling" is an English catch-all term that tends to encompass more foods than the Mandarin baozi or jiaozi (dumplings) do.</i></p>

				<h3>Charsiu bāo(叉燒包)</h3>
				<section class="text_pic">
					<p>Charsiu bao or chāshāobāo (Mandarin) is a Cantonese-style bao popular in Hong Kong. It features a smooth, thick, white exterior with a dark red filling of charsiu, a Cantonese style of diced barbecue pork. The pork is slow-cooked in a thick mixture of honey, soy sauce, oyster sauce, five spice, and sesame seed oil. The secret to the bun's dense, fluffy leavening is baking powder.
					<br><br>
					The tops of these bao crack into flower-like segments that expose the spongy texture inside. It's said to have been around since 200 AD, and it's now known as one of the four big kings of Hong Kong dim sum, alongside har gow, siu mai, and egg tarts.</p>

				<h3>Shuijian bāo (水煎包)</h3>
				<section class="text_pic">
					<p>This bao originates in Shandong in northern China. It has a pork and gelatin filling encased in a thick, tender semi-leavened dough. Instead of being steamed like most bao, shuijian bao is pan-fried. The contrast between the crunchiness of the bottom of the bao and the softness of the rest of the skin is the main attraction of this bao.
					<br><br>
					This bao often confused with its Shanghai counterpart, the shengjiang bao. The main difference between the two is their shape. The shuijian bao is more oblong and, unlike the shengjiang bao, it isn't topped with sesame. </p>

				<h3>Tāng bāo(湯包)</h3>
				<section class="text_pic">
					<p>A giant soup bao, often called a giant xiaolongbao or giant soup dumpling. This is the Goliath of soup bao and hails from the city of Wuxi in the Jiangsu province of China. Wuxi is known for its saccharine food and this dish is no exception. The giant bao stuffs crab roe, pork, gelatin, and sugar suspended in a soup. 
					<br><br>
					The skin is unleavened, but it is quite leathery and robust. To eat it, use a straw to suck the broth out before eating the skin.</p>

				<h3>Nǎihuáng bāo(奶黃包)</h3>
				<section class="text_pic">
					<p>Naihuang bao or custard buns are delicious steamed bao filled to the brim with hot egg custard. The buns themselves are smooth and round. The custard is both savory and sweet, and is always served piping hot. This bao is most reminiscent of chocolate lava cake, as the insides ooze out when you take a bite.
					<br><br>
					The bright yellow custard within is made from egg, dried milk powder, flour, heavy cream, melted butter, and sugar. A true delicacy!</p>

				<h3>Shòutáo bāo( 莲蓉包)</h3>
				<section class="text_pic" id="final_pic">
					<p>Shoutao bao are the original blueprint for the peach emoji (not actually). But surprisingly, they don't have any peach inside. These buns are filled with dried lotus seeds that have been stewed in hot water before being crushed and strained. Lotus seeds are a luxurious ingredient.
					<br><br>
					These bao are known as peach longevity bao because of a Chinese myth of a goddess who grows peaches of immortality in her garden. It's eaten at birthdays to with the celebrant a long and healthy life. It typically needs to be preordered from restaurants, just like a Western-style birthday cake.</p>
