                    <h1><b>Who are we?</b></h1>
                    <p class="body_txt">Phoenix ACTS is a nonprofit organization based in Phoenix, Arizona. Our goal is to help hospitalized children who can't attend school by bringing school to them. We do this through free tutoring for grades K-12, group lessons, and group activities to let kids and parents have fun during the toughest times. We currently offer services <a href="schedule.htm">every weekday</a> at Phoenix Children's Hospital.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h1><b>Our Volunteers</b></h1>
                    <p class="body_txt">Our volunteers are vetted through a comprehensive test to make sure they'll be the best tutors and teachers for your child. Our volunteers also take a special Phoenix ACTS course on the specific learning needs for hospitalized children. With Phoenix ACTS, your child and their future will be in good, caring hands.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h1><b>About Group Lessons</b></h1>
                    <p class="body_txt"><a href="schedule.htm">Every Thursday and Friday</a>, we will be hosting various group lessons and fun activities for children to get together and feel like a whole class. The group lessons will often cover interesting topics presented in a fun way, such as story times or learning about interesting animals. Join us for our special activities like finger painting, crafts, and group music lessons. Parents are welcome to join in these activities with their children. Have a child who can't make it out or can't be around other children right now? No worries, we'll also be live-streaming these group events!</p>
                    <br>

                    <h1><b>Our History</b></h1>
                    <p class="body_txt">Phoenix ACTS was started by three emboldened college students. While attending Estrella Mountain Community College, students Aaron Irby, Amani Medcroft, and Angelica Hazel Verdin all came together for a group project one day. They each realized that they had a passion for helping children in need. Suddenly, Angelica brought up the idea that the three of them could direct their passions towards something to help the community. With their education, love for teaching, and caring for children, they could help make a difference at hospitals in Arizona by teaching children. A few days later, the idea for Phoenix ACTS was born. Amani set up a website for them, Angelica brainstormed ways they could help children, Aaron helped put the plans into motion, and the rest was history.</p>
