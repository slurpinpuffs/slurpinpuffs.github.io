				<h2>The History of Bao</h2>
				<h3>Who made the first bao?</h3>
				<p>Baozi developed in Chinese culture as a filled form of <b>mantou</b>, a plain steamed dumpling that is often compared to bread. The story behind this fluffy delight explains not only its unique shape, but also why its development into baozi was such a natural one. 
				<br><br>
				Mantou is said to have been created by legendary 3rd Century military strategist Zhuge Liang. On the way back from battle during his famous Southern Campaign to quash a rebellion around the area which is now Sichuan province, Zhuge was faced with an enormous logistical challenge. The strategist had defeated his enemies, but was staring at the prospect of defeat not by an army, but by a river which was impossible to cross. The river was said to be closely guarded by a Deity, who refused to allow safe passage to Zhuge unless he threw the heads of 50 of his soldiers into the river. Wanting to satisfy the Deity’s demands without sacrificing his troops, Zhuge ordered for 50 buns that looked like human heads, due to their flat bases and round shapes, to be thrown into the river. The plan was a success, the Deity was deceived, safe passage was granted and the buns were named mantou (barbarian’s heads) in celebration of the famous victory that Zhuge had masterminded over the barbarian rebels.</p>

				<p>This story of military victory then developed into a people’s victory against the barbarities of bad lunch, as the buns became filled with a huge variety of delicious meats and vegetables. While the maker of the first Bao isn’t known, what is known is that each region of China is fiercely proud of their own traditional method of making the bread-based snack.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>What were the first baozi like?</h3>
				<p>The original bao bun was a fist-sized ball created using flour, yeast, sugar, baking powder, milk, and oil. The buns were pinched together on top and steamed to form a soft, sweet dough ball filled with meat. This delicacy spread quickly throughout Asia, changing slightly from region to region. </p>

							<td>These bao buns were changed from wheat to rice flour. The climate difference in this area created a more suitable environment for growing rice. The common filling for the buns found in Hong Kong was sweet barbeque pork. </td>
							<td>Taiwanese bao became a popular fast food item for a quick meal on the go. This version of bao was larger than traditional Chinese bao and typically filled with crab, beef, or sweet potato. </td>
							<td>The hugely popular soup dumplings we see throughout the US today were created in Shanghai. These dough balls are carefully crafted with a gelatine filling that turns into a delicious soup when steamed. The traditional way to enjoy these is to tear the dough, drink the soup, and then finish the dumpling. </td>
							<td>Today, you can find versions of bao buns throughout the entire world. Bao made a massive splash in the United States, and restaurants dedicated to this Chinese delicacy became popular. </td>
