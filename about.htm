				<h2>Instructions</h2>
				<ol>
					<img src="yeast.jpg" class="recipe_side" alt="An image of a bao wrapper.">
					<li>Add 3/4 cups warm water to a small bowl. Mix in 1 tsp sugar and 1 tsp yeast. Leave for 10-15 minutes until yeast activates. You'll know it's done when the yeast is forming bubbles on top of the water.</li>
					<li>In a large mixing bowl, add 2 cups flour. Add one third of the yeast-water from step 1. Stir it in thoroughly in one direction, then add in another third of the water. Stir again, then add the last bit of yeast-water. Stir well until too thick to stir.</li>
					<li>Use your hands to gently knead the dough in the bowl. If you feel that you don't have enough water, add a small amount at a time. Be careful, you don't want your dough to become too soft to work with. You'd rather have the dough be a little harder and dryer than too soft.</li>
					<li>Put dough in a large container. Cover it with plastic wrap and store it somewhere warm for about 90 minutes until the dough rises and doubles in size. If you don't have a warm place available, you can store your dough in a slightly warmed (~80F) oven.</li>
					<li>In a small bowl, add together 1 tbsp of soy sauce, oyster sauce, and Chinese rice cooking wine. Afterwards, add 2 tbsp of sesame oil and 0.4 cups of water. Stir this all together, and then add 1/4 tsb of salt and sugar. Mix until fully uniform, and add 2 tbsp of corn starch. Mix until everything is fully incorporated.</li>
					<img src="wrapper.jpg" class="recipe_side" alt="An image of a bao wrapper.">
					<li>In a separate bowl, put 12 oz of pork. Add the liquid mixture in parts to the bowl with pork. Stir the pork to ensure the liquid gets soaked up by the meat. Add some pinches of white pepper. Repeat until all the sauce has been incorporated in the pork. Add 1 tsp of minced ginger, and a chopped stalk of scallion. Mix until the vegetables are fully mixed in. Drain the extra liquid leftover in the bowl if there is any.</li>
					<li>Roll the dough into a long tube and divide it into 5 equal pieces. Press each piece out into a disc about 4 1/2 inches in diameter.</li>
					<li>Take a disc of dough and put a tablespoon of filling in the middle. Keeping your thumb on the inside of the wrapper, slowly pleat the edges into a series of fan shapes. Use your other thumb to pat down the filling and keep it in the wrapper. Try to do over 10 pleats. Once you reach the opposite edge of the wrapper, just twist the edges into a peak at the top. Repeat this for each of the 5 discs.</li>
					<li>Cover the bottom of a steamer with parchment paper or banana leaf. Place the baos inside and place the steamer in a warm place again for another 20-30 minutes to let them rise further. </li>

					<li>Heat up a pot of hot over a stove. The water should be well below boiling. Sit your steamer with your baos on top of the for 10-15 minutes.</li>
					<li>Turn the stove up to bring the water to a boil. Steam the baos for 20 minutes.</li>
					<li>After 20 minutes, take the steamer and pot off the stove. <b>Do not take the top off of your steamer yet, or your bao will sag.</b> Let them sit with the top on for another 5 minutes.</li>
					<li>Uncover and serve with your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
